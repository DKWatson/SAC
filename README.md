# SAC
Single Axis Controller  *** Now CAN, LIN and BiSS conversant!!

SAC is the rocket science of stepper-motor control. It does all the heavy lifting with respect to timing, signaling, acceleration, deceleration, step count, micro-stepping and more. It is the missing link in any linear/rotary solution, providing the bridge between a user control application and the electronics that drive modern stepper motors. All SAC needs are some simple instructions, everything else is taken care of.
